# Illustrator-Layer-Animation-Script
A js script for illustrator, to "animate" through the layers including a trace.

- Don't lock your layers (script stops here)
- use at least 4 frames
- layers must not start at 0.

Run this script by pressing ctrl+F12

Sadly the dialog is modal, you cannot work on your layers while it is open.
